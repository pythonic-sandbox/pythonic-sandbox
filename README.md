a project in which any features what so ever are added by anyone. 
## how this will all work
Anyone can submit pole requests with their code, any owner of the repository will check this for any code with malitious intent. 
Make sure that your PR body explains in detail what is contained in your pole request. 
If your PR is cleared we will add it to the repo. 
We will not fix any massive errors or pr's which contain many small errors, however we will fix very minor ones assuming there is only a few.
